        <h4>Mitigating personal information exposure on the web</h4>
        <p>Numerous studies have investigated mitigating personal information (PI) exposure on the web. These studies cover a variety of themes including the types of PI available on the web, mitigating PI exposure on social networks, and mitigating PI exposure from phishing attacks. This review focuses on the risks of exposure and the mitigation methods for these risks.</p>
        <p>The majority of studies agree on the information included within the definition of Personal Information (PI), this includes information that can identify an individual, including full name, date of birth, home address, personal identification numbers and biometric, educational data (McCallister, Grance, & Kent, 2010, p.13; Krishnamurthy & Wills, 2009, p.2; Irani, Webb, Li, & Pu, 2011, p.2). Krishnamurthy and Wills assert that PI includes any persistent static identifier belonging to individuals or small groups and includes IP and MAC addresses (2009, p.2). Krishnamurthy and Wills also suggest browser based methods for mitigating PI exposure on the web, including disabling cookies, disabling javascript, filtering ads and filtering third party content (2007, p.2). Their work shows that all methods were successful in preventing PI exposure, with only disabling javascript and filtering third party content having impacting on the page quality by breaking some interactions on web pages (Krishnamurthy & Wills, 2007, p.10).</p>
        <p>Many studies identified the risk of PI exposure on social networks, these studies agree that due to the nature of participation in social networks users are encouraged to provide large amounts of accurate PI onto their profiles (Irani et al., 2011, p.1; Po-Ching, & Pei-Ying, 2016, p .16). The majority of studies state that a user's friends may unintentionally leak their own and others PI through interactions including posting pictures, tagging users, wall posts, friends lists and birthday posts (Po-Ching, & Pei-Ying, 2016, p .16; Al Hasib, 2009, p.4;Lam, Chen & Chen, 2008, p.2). These studies also agree that PI leaked from social networks is potentially dangerous due to its accuracy and abundance, and that malicious users can also use this PI in social engineering and phishing (Po-Ching, & Pei-Ying, 2016, p .2; Al Hasib, 2009, p.4;Lam et al., 2008, p.2). Po-Ching and Pei-Ying introduce mitigation methods by informing users to be cautious when accepting friend requests and interacting with strangers, remove PI posted on walls and use privacy settings (2016, p.16). While Irani et al. suggested similar methods by mitigating PI leakage through increasing overall awareness of the risks by creating public services that advise users to reduce PI leakage by changing privacy settings and remove PI from social networks (2011, p.6).</p>
        <p>Krishnamurthy and Wills investigated the use of privacy settings within social networks, the results showed that the overwhelming majority of users retained the default privacy settings (2009, p.2). A minority of studies identified that default privacy settings on popular social networks were set to maximise the visibility of a user’s PI (Krishnamurthy & Wills, 2009, p.2; Gross & Acquisti, 2005, p.10). While these studies identified that privacy settings are not adequately used, neither of the studies fully identified the risks of completely public PI exposure or provided methods for mitigation. A minority of studies provided methods for mitigation, by advising users to set the default privacy settings to safer settings that keep their PI private (Irani et al., 2011, p.6; Po-Ching, & Pei-Ying, 2016, p .16; Al Hasib, 2009, p.5). While Al Hasib asserted that social network providers should provide stronger default privacy settings and offer guidelines to aid users in changing these settings. (2009, p.5).</p>
        <p>Irani et al. identified that the majority of social network users use multiple social networks and defined the total amount of PI available across these networks as an individual's social footprint (2011, p.1). Their work also shows that the available PI for exposure increases significantly if a user’s PI is collected from multiple social networks instead of a single network (2009, p.3). Vosecky, Hong and Shen (2009, p.1) agree by describing that “It also is more and more common that users are members of more than one social network at a time”. Yet Vosecky et al. identified a gap in the research that many of a user’s social network profiles may contain partial, missing or incorrect PI, potentially reducing the risk of PI exposure from multiple networks (2009, p.11). While these studies did not provide methods for mitigating PI exposure from multiple networks, Irani et al. identifies that a user mitigating PI exposure through strong privacy settings on a network is not effective if PI is combined from other networks with public privacy settings (2011, p.2).</p>
        <p>Many studies have identified phishing as a risk of PI exposure, these studies state that phishing can be achieved through emails and social networks potentially deceiving a user into providing PI (Zhang, Egelman, Cranor, & Hong, 2006, p.1; Irani et al., 2011, p.2; Al Hasib, 2009, p.4). A majority of studies identified that phishing attacks have the potential to become more effective if an individual’s previously exposed PI is used in the attack (Irani et al., 2011, p.2; Al Hasib, 2009, p.4). Lam et al. further identified that existing rules for mitigating phishing messages such as “checking if the email includes your real name because phishers do not have personal information” is not reliable due to the abundance of existing PI available for a malicious user to use within the phishing attack (2008, p.14). Zhang et al. (2006, p.2) tested existing anti-phishing tools for their effectiveness in mitigating phishing attacks, the study found that the majority of tools did not correctly identify phishing URLs with only one tool identifying 90% of these URLs while also incorrectly identifying many legitimate URLs.</p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>The review’s purpose was to understand existing studies that have researched why and how to mitigate personal information exposure on the web. It is clear from the research that most of the studies agree on the risks of this exposure but are not as consistent on the available and proposed methods for mitigating as not all studies identified whether these methods are successful in mitigating PI exposure. Although the majority of studies outlined methods of mitigation for both users and the providers of web services it is clear that more research is required on the methods that users can use to mitigate exposure of their PI on the web.</p>
